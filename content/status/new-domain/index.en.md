Bought a new domain, `ohmykreee.top` -> `kre3.net`, and will gradually abandon the `ohmykreee.top` domain in the future.

(The reason? Alibaba Cloud raised the domain renewal price for no reason, which led to a loss of trust in it.jpg)

I'm currently in a state of hard work + trying to learn new (non-programming/network related) things, I hope I can come up with something big... ~~It's not ðŸ’©~~
